            <p>They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?</p><p>Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. You really think you can fly that thing? God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.</p><p>Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.</p><p>Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?</p><p>Just my luck, no ice. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.</p>
